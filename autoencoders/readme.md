Under this project, I've created a basic auto-encoder to compress and decompress images.
1. normal autoencoder to create same image after decompressing it. The task was carried out on MNIST hand-written image dataset.
2. autuencoder to de-noise the dataset, on the same dataset as 1.
3. text-reconstruction from a piece of paper where the image are present of a crumbled paper or coffee spilled paper.


Images for the 3rd part are present at the below link:
